# Lego Builder Plan

## General Idea
- Start with an empty board, no need to use a checkerboard.
- User can click on a face, and it will place a block there, will need an raycasting algorithm that snaps to the nearest grid cell
- There should also be a drop animation when placing a block

## Blocks
- Will start with a 1 * 1 * 1 block model, and eventually add more blocks.
